PersonalRecipeCreator is a user-friendly C# Windows Form application that enables users to create their own recipes by entering the name, measurement, and quantity of each ingredient. With this application, users can also add recipe steps, scale recipes up or down, and clear recipe details effortlessly. Users can now add also multiple recipes, food groups and calories, and also view each individual recipe they have created. Users can also filter their list of recipes to search for specific recipes.

## 📝 Feedback and Updates

In this final build, users can now filter their recipe list by entering a specific ingredient to that is present in the recipe they are searching for. This will filter the list and display the recipe that contains the ingredient the user entered. Users can also add an unlimited number of recipes, name each recipe they create, and select a recipe to view from their list. All the recipes are now displayed in alphabetical order and each ingredient in the recipe can be allocated a specific number of calories as well as a food group classification.

The software now calculates the total calories of all the ingredients in a specific recipe then displays a notification message informing the user if their recipe exceeds a 300-calorie threshold.
